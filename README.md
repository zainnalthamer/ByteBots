# ByteBots

ByteBots is a 3D educational game designed to teach programming fundamentals through interactive gameplay, visual puzzles, and AI-assisted learning.  
Instead of writing code, players solve problems using drag-and-drop logic blocks, explore a story-driven world, and receive contextual guidance from an in-game AI companion called LUMA.

The project focuses on making programming concepts approachable, engaging, and meaningful for beginners.

## Game Overview

ByteBots transforms abstract programming ideas into tangible in-game actions. Players progress through quests, interact with NPCs, and repair corrupted environments by solving programming puzzles related to:
- Variables  
- Conditionals  
- Comparisons  
- Loops  
- Functions

Learning is reinforced through immediate visual feedback, narrative progression, and optional AI support.

## Key Features

- Interactive 3D puzzle-based learning
- Visual block-based programming (drag & drop)
- AI-assisted learning companion (LUMA)
- Quest-based progression system
- NPC interactions and dialogue
- Centralized notebook system for all puzzles
- Integrated learning panel (E-Reader)
- Persistent save and load system

## AI-Assisted Learning (LUMA)

LUMA is an in-game AI companion that supports players while they solve puzzles.

- Explains programming concepts in simple language  
- Provides contextual hints instead of direct answers  
- Encourages logical thinking and experimentation  

The AI operates locally, ensuring privacy and preventing data collection, while remaining fully integrated into the game’s narrative.
